# ServerKit measurements

The README tables are a dated snapshot, generated from the same JSON files for
English, Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese. They separate source inventory from
build sizes and runtime measurements. A count of collected tests is not a count
of passing tests, and compressed asset bytes are not a page-load benchmark.

## Recorded snapshot

- [Source inventory](measurements/repository.json): measured on September 5,
  2026 with Python 3.11.7 on Windows. The clean collection count was also checked
  on Linux. The base source revision, whether measured source has uncommitted
  changes, and a hash of that measured source are recorded. The hash describes
  the working files, so a pre-commit snapshot is not attributed to an unchanged
  historical revision.
- [Production build inventory](measurements/frontend-build.json): Node version,
  per-asset byte/gzip sizes and a content hash are recorded. Built from an
  isolated copy of tracked/new frontend source after the request/form cleanup,
  excluding ignored files and reusing the installed dependencies, with
  `npm run build`. Its code hash matched the ordinary working-checkout build.
- Runtime memory and container image bytes are **unmeasured in this snapshot**.
  The previous ~180 MB RAM and 501 MB image figures had no reproducible
  environment or image digest, so they were removed instead of repeated.

### What each number includes

| Measurement | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Core route declarations | Route decorators in Git-tracked Python under `backend/app/api/`. A function with two route decorators counts twice. This is source inventory, not the set of enabled runtime endpoints. |
| Core blueprint declarations | `Blueprint(...)` declarations in the same files. Extension blueprints and conditionally loaded routes are outside this count. |
| Explicit method/route pairs | Literal route methods, excluding automatic HEAD/OPTIONS. The JSON separately reports declarations whose methods cannot be resolved statically. |
| App templates | Git-tracked YAML files directly inside `backend/templates/`; nested database-extension templates are excluded. |
| Backend tests | Pytest collection from `backend/tests` using the existing clean-collection instrument; ignored installed extension copies do not inflate the count. Skipped/opt-in tests can still be collected. |
| HTML-linked code | JS/MJS/CSS referenced by script, stylesheet or modulepreload tags in production `index.html`. Later runtime requests, fonts and images are excluded. |
| All built code | Every JS/MJS/CSS file in the production output, including lazy chunks, translations, extension code and public vendor shims. HTML, fonts, images, source maps and other assets are excluded. |
| Gzip bytes | Sum of each file compressed independently with gzip level 9. MB means 1,000,000 bytes. These are reproducible compression estimates; actual transfer depends on server compression and browser caching. |

The old “1.75 MB web UI” number had no precise asset scope. The new HTML-linked
and all-code totals must not be interpreted as a measured speedup over that
old figure. Non-English locale chunks are already loaded on demand; their
build-size warnings alone do not show that every visitor downloads them.

## Refresh the source and build measurements

Use the backend Python environment with its dependencies installed. From the
repository root:

```bash
python scripts/measure-repository.py --collect-tests --output docs/measurements/repository.json
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run measure:build -- --output ../docs/measurements/frontend-build.json
cd ..
python scripts/update-readme-measurements.py --write
python scripts/update-readme-measurements.py
```

On Windows, `backend\venv\Scripts\python.exe` can replace `python`. Review the
snapshot and README diffs together. The final command checks agreement between
all translated tables and the snapshots; it does not pretend an old build
snapshot is a fresh measurement. Rebuild when publishing new size claims.

## Measure API latency and database work

The panel already records API timings through its analytics middleware. For a
bounded investigation, enable `SERVERKIT_PROFILE_REQUESTS=true` on an authorized
local or staging panel and restart it. This adds a `Server-Timing` response
header containing application elapsed time, SQL elapsed time and statement
count. It records neither SQL text nor parameters and creates no new database
table. The profiler is off by default and installs no SQL listeners when off.

Use the real HTTP sampler against the running panel:

```bash
python scripts/profile-api.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:47927 --path /api/v1/system/health --samples 20 --warmup 2 --output .reviews/api-profile.json
```

For protected endpoints, supply a short-lived JWT through
`SERVERKIT_PROFILE_TOKEN`, or `SERVERKIT_PROFILE_API_KEY` only for routes that
already support API keys. Do not supply both. The sampler makes GET requests,
refuses redirects, and does not include bodies, credentials or query values in
its report. HTTP/transport failures are recorded and make the command fail.
Missing profiler headers produce `null` fields, never invented zero costs.

Reports contain sample count, response sizes/statuses, min/p50/p95/max latency,
and optional application/SQL distributions. Warmup is excluded from the latency
summary, but its requests and failures remain visible. Turn profiling off when
the investigation is finished.

Record panel revision, OS/architecture, Python version, database engine,
server/resource counts, cache state, concurrency and whether the panel is idle
or loaded. Compare the same dataset and environment before and after a change.
The sampler is sequential and does not establish throughput under concurrency.
Profiler SQL counts cover statements on the HTTP request thread through response
construction; background jobs and streamed body iteration are not included.

## Measure memory, images and browser loading separately

- **Memory:** record the exact process/container, workload, uptime and sampling
  interval. Process RSS and Docker memory accounting are different measurements.
  Include workers and enabled services; do not describe one idle sample as a
  universal minimum or capacity guarantee.
- **Image size:** record image digest, architecture, build arguments and whether
  bytes describe the local uncompressed image or registry transfer. A cached
  image from a different commit is not a measurement of the current source.
- **Browser loading:** record cold/warm cache, device, connection, route, locale
  and extension set. Use a production build and inspect actual requests and
  navigation timings; source-file counts and total dist size cannot substitute
  for this. Large assets should be optimized when that trace shows they affect
  a relevant user flow.

No production latency, memory, capacity or percentage-speedup claim is made by
the source/build snapshot. Existing fleet tests enforce one metrics query per
reader at multiple fleet sizes; the opt-in profiler makes that kind of query
budget observable on a running panel too.
