"""The panel half of fleet policies.

Two jobs, and neither of them is deciding anything. ServerKit Cloud holds the
policy; this panel reports what is true and, when asked with a consent the
operator granted, changes it.

**Facts.** `build_facts()` assembles one document from services that already
exist — the firewall, fail2ban, the 2FA policy, the panel updater, backup
policies, the storage destination — and it advertises a `capabilities` list
naming only the bundles it could actually read. That list is the whole of the
capability gate: a rule Cloud cannot get facts for reads "not checkable here"
rather than "failing", which is FLEET_CONTRACT rule 2 and the difference
between a useful compliance page and a wall of red on servers that are fine.

**Repairs.** Four handlers, each calling the panel's own path — the same code
an operator pressing the button in this panel would run. A repair this install
cannot perform says so in a sentence rather than failing obscurely; Cloud shows
that sentence next to the finding.
