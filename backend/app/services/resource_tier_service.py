"""
Resource Tier / Server Capacity Service

Answers two questions that the panel has to keep separate:

1. "What did we install?" — the install profile (minimal/standard/full). Decided
   once by install.sh, recorded in config, and readable from
   ``install_profile_service``. It is a starting point, never a permanent SKU.

2. "What can this box still hold?" — headroom. This is live: it changes every
   time the operator deploys something, and it is what the UI should actually
   surface.

The original three-bucket tier (lite/standard/performance) conflated the two.
It classified a server once from total CPU/RAM and then permanently disabled a
button, which is both wrong the moment the VPS is resized and reads like a
paywall on an OSS panel. ``tier`` is still derived and returned for the callers
that display it, but every feature flag is now advisory — the panel reports
headroom and lets the operator decide.
