"""The Storage Hub on the panel side.

ServerKit Cloud holds one set of object-storage credentials and hands each
server its own prefix in the bucket. This module is the whole panel half of
that: four command handlers, and the snapshot the panel sends back on the
`storage` stream.

What it deliberately does not do is re-implement anything. The destination
lands in `storage.json` through `StorageProviderService.save_config`, which
every upload, list and verify path in the panel already reads — including
`path_prefix`, which those paths have always honoured. Cloud is therefore
just another way of filling in the form on Backups > Storage, and a backup
run does not know or care which one was used.

While a destination is managed by Cloud, `managed_by_cloud` is set in
storage.json and the local form is read-only: two places writing the same
config would race, and the operator should be told where it is coming from
rather than watching their edit disappear.
