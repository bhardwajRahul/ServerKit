"""A tombstone must never look like a live domain.

Making Domain soft-deletable silently changed the meaning of every existing
`Domain.query`: before, it could only return live rows. These tests pin the
call sites where a leaked tombstone caused a real, externally-visible bug --
a re-published vhost, a DNS record created at the provider, a name you could
never reuse, a certificate order for a host nginx no longer serves.
