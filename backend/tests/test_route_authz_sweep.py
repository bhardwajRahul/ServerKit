"""Authorization sweep — the default-deny backstop for mutating routes.

Motivation
----------
GHSA-r4q7-x795-vr4j: ``POST /api/v1/workspaces/`` shipped gated only by
``@jwt_required()``, so a read-only *viewer* could create and administer
workspaces. It was one forgotten authorization check, and it was not the only
one — an audit of every mutating route turned up the same class in the docker
compose read routes (arbitrary-path log/config disclosure) and the whole
monitors surface (viewer could create/edit/delete monitors and incidents).

The root cause is architectural: ServerKit has **no enforced default-deny**.
Authorization is opt-in per route, via a decorator *or* an inline helper
(``_can_edit_app``, ``require_workspace_role``, ``_check_scope``, ...). Nothing
fails closed when an author forgets, so each new feature file is one missing
line away from re-introducing the bug.

This module is the CI backstop for that class. It has two parts:

* ``test_fixed_routes_reject_non_admins`` — a precise, hermetic proof that the
  specific routes fixed alongside the advisory (docker compose + monitors)
  reject a viewer *and* a developer. These use ``@permission_required`` /
  ``@admin_required``, which run before the view body, so a dummy id still
  exercises the gate (403, not a 404 for the missing row).

* ``test_no_mutating_route_succeeds_for_a_viewer`` — the regression net. It
  fires every mutating route as a viewer and asserts none returns a 2xx unless
  its endpoint is in ``VIEWER_WRITABLE`` (a reviewed allowlist). A newly-added
  route that forgets to gate and happily answers a viewer with ``201`` trips
  this test until the author either gates it or consciously allowlists it.

Known limitation: a route with a path parameter that resolves its resource
(and 404s) *before* checking authorization is invisible to the live-fire net
— the 404 masks a missing gate. The net therefore catches the clearest
regressions (creates and global toggles with no path param); resource-scoped
routes need their own per-feature tests. See ``VIEWER_WRITABLE`` notes for the
handful of endpoints that remain viewer-writable and are tracked as follow-ups.
